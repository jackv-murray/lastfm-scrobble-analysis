Now we'll build the pipeline in Mage, an open-source pipeline tool with orchestration, transformation and integration features. Mage separates each distinct phase of a pipeline into testable and reusable blocks of code and has a hybrid development environment, with an interactive GUI. 

## Starting Mage

1. Navigate to the mage-ai folder and build the mage container ```docker compose build```
2. Start the docker container with ```docker compose up```
3. Navigate to ```localhost:6789``` - you may need to [forward](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) this port
